# cpr-web-scraping
Scrapes data from a bunch of websites.

## Files of interest
1. [`chennai-curler.py`](./chennai-curler.py) and [`chennai-pdf-scraper.py`](./chennai-pdf-scraper.py)
2. [`mumbai-curler.py`](./mumbai-curler.py)
3. [`delhi-curler.py`](./delhi-curler.py)
4. `cpcb-curler.py`
5. ...

## Notes
Was going to use [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) to scrape but then figured out a cURL(y) solution. You can see the Playwright implementation in [`scrape-chennai.js`](./scrape-chennai.js).
